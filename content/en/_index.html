        <p>The joint International Degrowth and European Society for Ecological Economics conference will be held in Pontevedra in June 2024. The Río Lérez, is a river that runs through the city and provides the inspiration for the conference's identity. It runs through the circle, connecting people to water and nature. The symbol represents a meeting point for different academic disciplines, students, and the public; a social site for important discussion and knowledge exchange.<br></p>
