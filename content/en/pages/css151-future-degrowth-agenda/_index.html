  This interactive closed session will consist of authors discussing and presenting their chapters from the forthcoming edited book A future degrowth agenda: Decolonial voices and interdisciplinary perspective. The session will be bringing degrowth in discussion with critical fields of study often neglected in mainstream degrowth scholarship, such as critical race theory, art, literature, folklore, and indigeneity. The authors/participants in the session will be a combination of researchers and practitioners.
