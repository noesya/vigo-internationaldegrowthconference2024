summary: >
  The interactive session will explore the transformative power of sufficiency in providing the infrastructures and policies that shape our societies in a way that reduces resource consumption and ensures well-being for all. Introduced by a keynote speech from Seán Fearon, a Research Fellow at CUSP, we dive into the FULFILL project's results, revealing insights from the micro- (individuals and households), meso- (local initiatives) and  macro level (national and EU policies enabling sufficiency habits). By combining expert presentations, interactive World Café discussions, and participatory policy voting, this session provides a comprehensive understanding of sufficiency while actively engaging participants in exploring its applications and potential policy implications.
