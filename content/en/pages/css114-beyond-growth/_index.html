summary: >
  Bodh Gaya, being a UNESCO World-Heritage site since 2002 and the place of Buddhaâ€™s enlightenment, is known as a transnational tourist spot, given its extensive heritage, including the Mahabodhi temple complex and more than two hundred international Buddhist monasteries, which mostly developed after the 1950s. Heritage-based planning has remained a state-led activity in postcolonial India. The state used heritage planning as a tool to pursue unhindered economic growth and an exercise of nation-building. Dominant developmental actors focused on trickle-down economic theories based on unhindered growth to bring positive socio-economic transformations at the local heritage sites, which has largely failed to deliver inclusive growth. This session will re-imagine heritage-making in Bodh Gaya from a post-growth perspective. The papers in this session will examine the disconnect between the growth of Bodh Gaya and the well-being of the local populace and explore alternative perspectives for conserving the World Heritage site for future generations.
