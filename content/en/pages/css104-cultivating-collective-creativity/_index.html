  Guided group evaluation of flush toilet technology and a vermi-composting alternative. Flush toilets have proliferated throughout the developed world as a symbol of progress but have allowed greater concentrations of people to live in closer proximity. A problem that has eventuated is that the increased population density has created detrimental concentrated impacts on the water bodies these systems discharge into. The evaluation will adopt a Māori epistemology for sharing knowledge. The goal of this epistemology is ensuring the flourishing of ecosystems. For flourishing to occur, the life supporting capacity of ecosystems (mauri) must be enhanced and understood from the perspective of intrinsic belonging. The deep understanding embodied in mauri is now being relied upon in New Zealand to inform relationships to water, to reform past policy and laws, to respond to challenges such as climate change and natural disasters, and to identify a more sustainable future.
