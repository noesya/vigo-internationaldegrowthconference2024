summary: >
  The Degrowth Movement and scholarship has thus far paid very little attention to the rural and the agrarian questions. In this special session, we want to showcase the rural as the foundation for social-ecological just transitions, and to challenge the dominant city-driven values, ideologies, and imaginaries of progressive social movements (including degrowth). We consider the rural as an appropriate space for reinventing subsistence economies, which put social reproduction at the forefront. Rural space and peasants hold and apply regenerative and social-reproductive practices that are intrinsically linked to resilience, and sustainable local livelihoods from the perspective of social-ecological metabolism. While none of these aspects automatically implies socio-ecological justice – past, present, and future – the potential of rural space for degrowth transformations must urgently be acknowledged within the Degrowth Movement, especially in the face of the deeply exploitative metabolism – interlinked with industrial capitalism – of the urban metropolitan areas.
