  There is a growing body of literature analysing the principles of degrowth across the specific challenges of urban planning and urban studies. However, this scholarship remains overwhelmingly urban, and empirical work primarily focused on experiences of planning for degrowth in large cities. This session seeks to focus the postgrowth debate on the urbanised periphery as a critical space, given its financial and environmental unsustainability as well as its vulnerability to climate change. While mainstream academia and policy argues for the densification (hence growth) of cities’ peripheries to tackle their financial, social and environmental problems; alternative scholarship suggests the spatial and socio-technical character of cities’ peripheries puts them in a privileged position to move beyond the growth paradigm. This call seeks contributions exploring whether and how a postgrowth future can be operationalised in the urbanized periphery that secures the livelihoods and good quality of life of their residents.

        <p>We propose one special session on post-growth periurban infrastructural planning in European peripheral regions. There is a growing body of literature analysing the principles of degrowth across the specific challenges of urban planning and urban studies. However, this scholarship remains overwhelmingly urban, and empirical work primarily focused on experiences of planning for degrowth in large capital cities in Central and North Europe.</p><p>This session seeks to focus the post-growth debate on those territories beyond the traditional dense and bounded city core, on the urbanised periphery suburbs as a critical space, given (1) not only its growing nature-more than 87% of the European population will live in cities’ periphery by 2050-, but also its (2) unsustainability linked to high consumption levels, financial cost of running infrastructures, and social inequalities across metropolitan areas; and (3) its vulnerability to climate change as recognised by the last IPCC report. </p><p>While mainstream academia and policy discourse support a growth and densification approach on the urbanised periphery to achieve 'an ideal form' that is more sustainable and supports more efficient economies of scale, we would like to explore alternative post-growth paths that can secure the livelihoods and quality of life of suburban dwellers.</p><p>Furthermore, degrowth literature has generally been grounded on the Global North or the Global South, with peripheral European regions (Atlantic Europe or Southern Europe) being subsumed in the Global North narrative. However, these regions are in a paradoxical situation, as they have historically experienced less growth, have been subject to fiscal control and austerity, but are undergoing structural changes influenced by European policies as well as infrastructural growth funded by European programs (EDERF, Next Generation, etc.). </p><p>In this context we seek contributions exploring questions such as (but not limited to):</p><ul> <li>·         Can we find post-growth projects/agendas/initiatives on infrastructures (water, sanitation, health, education, care, food production, etc.) in the urbanised periphery in Southern Europe and/or Atlantic Europe that challenge the growth and densification approach? And how does the socio-economic and spatial character of the urbanised periphery influence the implementation of these post-growth initiatives?</li> <li>·         How are these initiatives materialising and what actors are guiding them? Can we find processes of postgrowth that go beyond individual/singular experiences? And if not, how can we upscale them? Does the critical suburban governance literature offer a valid framework to understand these?</li> </ul><p>·         And what kind of post-growth imaginaries are guiding these initiatives in these peripheral regions? Are these linked to processes of planning in the context of economic stagnation or contraction or are these guided by political agendas that seek to envision a post-capitalist world? Can these two be reconciled to secure a better quality of life for suburban dwellers?</p><ul><li>·         Do European policies ease or hamper the capacity of local and regional actors (re)producing and/or governing suburban infrastructures to implement post-growth policies, projects and/or initiatives?</li></ul><p>                  </p><p>The format we are proposing is a traditional one, but we will provide a template for contributors to respond to, so we can structure presentations and discussions to align either types of infrastructures, regions, or any other theme that may emerge. We also plan to circulate the call for abstracts among policy makers, practitioners, activists, and other actors involved in the planning and governing of infrastructures in suburban areas in Galicia (in the Atlantic Region), hoping that we can have enough participants of this peripheral region. If that is the case, we will suggest a second session where we will be able to have a more targeted debate.</p>
