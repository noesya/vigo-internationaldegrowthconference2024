summary: >
  The dramatization showcases two distinct realities within the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga Biomes, examining their potential for sustainable scenarios. Using theater as a tool, it highlights the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different production methods. Focused on three cities within the São Francisco River basin, this exploration prompts a re-evaluation of current sustainability paths and policies. It aims to reshape the trajectory towards a more inclusive and economically viable scenario by involving diverse stakeholders, from small producers to legislators. This production evolved from the 3H4SDG workshops, employing a three-stage process, combining creative expressions and systemic thinking. The XPaths project, led by the Stockholm Resilience Center, drives this effort to construct a Strategic Action Plan for environmental sustainability, social justice, and the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the São Francisco River Basin, considering the intricacies of each region's challenges and systemic structures.
