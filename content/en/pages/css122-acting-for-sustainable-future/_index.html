summary: >
  The dramatization showcases two distinct realities within the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga Biomes, examining their potential for sustainable scenarios. Using theater as a tool, it highlights the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different production methods. Focused on three cities within the São Francisco River basin, this exploration prompts a re-evaluation of current sustainability paths and policies. It aims to reshape the trajectory towards a more inclusive and economically viable scenario by involving diverse stakeholders, from small producers to legislators. This production evolved from the 3H4SDG workshops, employing a three-stage process, combining creative expressions and systemic thinking. The XPaths project, led by the Stockholm Resilience Center, drives this effort to construct a Strategic Action Plan for environmental sustainability, social justice, and the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the São Francisco River Basin, considering the intricacies of each region's challenges and systemic structures.

        <p>The dramatization offers a unique<br>perspective on the potential for sustainable scenarios by exploring two<br>distinct realities within the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga Biomes. It delves<br>into the environmental, social, and economic impacts of various production<br>methods, reinterpreting these complexities through the lens of theater. This<br>creative exploration is focused on three cities and their surrounding regions:<br>Campina Grande-PB, Barreiras-BA, and Petrolina-PE, all located within the São<br>Francisco River basin. It challenges the established trajectories for<br>sustainability and calls for a re-evaluation of policies to create a more<br>inclusive future that aligns with economic needs and emerging demands. The<br>process involves a diverse array of voices, from small producers and citizens<br>to farmers, consumers, workers, large producers, entrepreneurs, and governing<br>bodies. The ultimate goal is to foster sustainability that respects natural<br>limits and is accessible to all.</p><p>This production has its roots in the 3H4SDG<br>workshops, a method combining the 3H diagram, systemic thinking tools, and<br>creative processes. It unfolds in three stages: STAGE 1 envisions a sustainable<br>future considering economic, social, environmental, and governance dimensions.<br>Creative expressions, such as letters, drawings, or plays, encapsulate these<br>aspirations. The resulting performance was filmed and presented in a virtual<br>meeting in November 2022, with feedback incorporated into a revised version for<br>an in-person presentation in May 2023. The approach adapts to the online<br>environment and incorporates Forum Theater concepts.</p><p>This process is part of the XPaths project,<br>led by the Stockholm Resilience Center (<a href="https://www.xpathsfutures.org/">https://www.xpathsfutures.org/</a>)<br>and has three countries as case studies: Brazil, Senegal, and Spain. It aims to<br>co-create a Strategic Action Plan for the region, prioritizing environmental<br>sustainability and social justice while contributing to the implementation of<br>the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the 2030 Agenda (UN,<br>2015). The underlying principle is that sustainability efforts should address<br>region-specific challenges rooted in interrelated causes and systemic<br>structures. Furthermore, it's essential to highlight that in the dialogues<br>emerged the lack of participation and the violation of rights experienced by<br>traditional and indigenous communities. Taís Sonetti-González, the project's<br>doctoral student and a representative of the Brazilian case study, added a new<br>scale into the project, the traditional and indigenous communities. They are:<br>Artisanal Fisheries in the Rio Grande Basin, Geraizeiros in the Rio de Janeiro<br>Basin, and Indigenous Populations in Western Bahia. This holistic approach<br>embodies the potential to contribute to discussions in ecological economics and<br>degrowth.</p><p><b>Dynamic proposed for the session</b></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p>The idea of this session would be to<br>present the video theater, followed by a small presentation of what went behind<br>the scenes of writing the script, training, recording, editing, on-line<br>presentation, re-writing the script, training, in-person exhibition, recording,<br>and final editing - together with the reflection on how this process<br>collaborated with the research process itself and the final objective of<br>writing the Action Plan, after the presentation a time to Q&amp;A.</p><p>This session would take 45 minutes. </p><ul> <br><li>10 minutes presentation</li> <br><li>15 minutes to play the theatre (in Portugues with subtitles in English)</li> <br><li>20 minutes to Q&amp;A with audience</li> <br> </ul>
