summary: >
  Inspired by Pontevedra’s semi-peripheral location within geographies of degrowth, this special session asks: What kind of knowledges around transformation and social change can be gleaned when theorizing and researching from a peripheral position, i.e., in less densely populated areas, relatively disconnected from major urban centres?
  
  Degrowth scholars have recently engaged with questions of transformation (Schmid 2019; Smith et al., 2021), planning (Savini et al., 2022) and strategy (Barlow et al., 2022), but without much consideration of more peripheral areas, which however may challenge conventional wisdom around transformation, and/or be potentially more difficult to transform.
  
  In this session we explore: How are trajectories and narratives of transformation complicated when considered from the standpoint of peripheral zones? What kind of practices and mechanisms should be included for degrowth planning and theorising? Conversely: how may thinking-with peripheries challenge and alter dominant ways of thinking about transformation and generate novel approaches to transformation?
