summary: >
  To transition towards sustainable socio-ecological systems, it is necessary to analyze the issues generated by each economic sector and explore existing and emerging alternatives. This field has been analyzed from various perspectives, such as ecological economics, political ecology, and agroecology, although not always in an integrated manner. In this case, the session aims to create a space for discussion between metabolic analyses and those related to the transition towards an alternative food system, taking into account their specificities. To achieve this, the goal is to foster an inter/transdisciplinary dialogue based on research advancements within the framework of social metabolism, but incorporating theoretical and methodological innovations resulting from this integration with other approaches, such as agroecology. These synergies will allow us to clarify the negative socio-environmental impacts of industrial agriculture and food globalization, as well as highlight the actions deployed by different social actors towards socio-ecological change.
