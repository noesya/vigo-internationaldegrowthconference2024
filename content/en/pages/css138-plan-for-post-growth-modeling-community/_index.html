summary: >
  The post-growth modeling community is growing in Europe and around the world, with intersections between integrated assessment modeling (IAM) and macroeconomic-ecological modeling communities. This is the first of two workshops together designed to facilitate a post-growth community modeling process.
  
  This interactive (90-minute) first session aims to create a high-level strategic plan for degrowth community modeling. What are key goals of the community to maximize policy impact? What are necessary steps to achieve these goals? What tools are currently available? What are potential barriers? What are the key groups to be involved from the start?
  
  This interactive discussion format will focus on the potential strategic value of a community integrated assessment model within/beyond the degrowth movement. Beyond the general assessment, we intend to discuss the processes necessary to create joint open-source degrowth models and scenarios with a broad range of users, as well as the limitations of modeling post-growth scenarios.
