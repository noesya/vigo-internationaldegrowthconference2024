summary: >
  The degrowth modeling community is growing, with intersections with the integrated assessment modeling (IAM) and macroeconomic-ecological modeling communities. Ongoing work includes how to model degrowth or to use integrated assessment modeling to mainstream degrowth ideals.
  
  This is the second of two workshops that together aim to work towards a degrowth community.
  
  The session will discuss how to strengthen collaboration in the community, towards improved scientific understanding across different model frameworks. It aims to be a more practical discussion than the session “A strategic 5/10-year plan for a degrowth modeling community” which focuses on bigger strategic impact questions.
  
  Topics include:
  
  (1) Interoperability: establishing a common data template to facilitate comparisons, and connect research groups. Documentation.
  
  (2) Model intercomparison projects: understanding how degrowth models differ.
  
  (3) Feeding into IPCC assessments: how to increase policy relevance and increase chance of adoption.
  
  (4) Interacting with other modeling communities: especially IAMC and EDITS.
