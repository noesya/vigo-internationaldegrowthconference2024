summary: >
  There is a consensus that the key drivers of the prevalent environmental crises – biodiversity loss and climate breakdown – stem from the complex economic, social and environmental entanglements of the Capitalocene (Haraway 2015). At the core of the Capitalocene is the neoliberal logic of expanding the economic realm into society’s every sector. Alternatives are not easy to articulate or to harness into workable solutions because the neoliberal logic is highly resistant. Ironically, to counter the damages stemming from the thoroughgoing economic institutionalisation, which remains all but blind to the plural values of nature, more formalisation and economic valorisation is often prescribed.
  
  For this session, we invite papers that explore current processes of commodification and decommodification, and papers that explore alternatives. For example, papers that interrogate the challenges and opportunities faced by economic institutionalisation of nature that subvert the Capitalocene and aim to depart from or resist commodification.
