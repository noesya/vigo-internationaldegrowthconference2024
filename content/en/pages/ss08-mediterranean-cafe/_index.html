summary: >
  To deliver on climate ambitions, voices and solutions that amplify regional and local particularities and place-based approaches must be incorporated into research, policy and action. This implies incorporating visions specific to the Mediterranean region carried out in Southern Europe, the Levant and Northern Africa concerning local geographies and particular themes such as heat waves, forest fires, water scarcity, agriculture, landgrabs, touristification, polarization, far-right populism, autocracy, disaster displacement and migration - all core axes of discussion for a future under degrowth.
  
  This special session will focus on specificities of the Mediterranean Region, one of the &quot;hotspots&quot; of the climate crisis with pronounced vulnerability grappling with the rising emissions while being home to over 500 million people. A Mediterranean cafe-style session will welcome participation focusing on regional particularities with global implications, critical voices, methodologies and epistemologies for climate-resilient development from the South while also valuing local researcher talents working on common issues.

        <p><b>How?</b>  Our proposed special session will be open, welcoming participants' submissions related to geographies and themes emerging from Southern Europe, the Levant and Northern Africa (covering the Mediterranean Region) and will be facilitated in the format of a World or, in this case, Mediterranean Café Style Session. The total time of 90 minutes will be allocated to a 5-minute introduction, 5 tables in a wold/Mediterranean cafe format of 12 minutes each (60 minutes) ending with a 25-minute plenary session.</p><p>  </p><p><b>What?</b>  The session is designed to purposefully prioritise local and regional specificities, methodologies, and action focusing on the Mediterranean region's climate vulnerabilities and priority areas of action regarding ecosystems and people. Interventions prioritising particular regional themes (e.g. waves, forest fires, water scarcity, agricultural losses, polarization, far-right populism, autocracy, displacement and migration) will be promoted. The Mediterranean region is a site of encounters not only between the global North and global South, between the East and the West but as well as between xenophobic borders and migrant solidarity, and between austerity-induced scarcity and abundance of care.</p><p>  </p><p>Therefore, this session will also explore how this specific spatial frontier can be mobilized to produce alternative solutions for the problems we are experiencing not only locally but also globally while also setting value-able visions for the future.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p>We therefore welcome methodologies in the search for such alternative solutions and visions both locally and globally. We will also provide space for research and researcher challenges (e.g. precarious working conditions and temporary research contracts) coming from the Mediterranean Region as a means to unite around common concerns yet support future supported roles and networking, capacities.</p><p>  </p><p><b>Why?</b>  The special sessions' relevance to the Ecological Economics and Degrowth community is plentiful. </p><p>  </p><p>First, it is an attempt to challenge hegemonic voices coming from Northern Europe in terms of presence and weight in contributing to climate science and action. We believe that the location of the conference in Pontevedra will be an opportunity to break away from research inequalities and elevate our session findings. This will also help overcome the fragmentation across the North and the South in the research panorama. Second, the session will provide an opportunity to pool different research methodologies that can be adapted, replicated and reproduced in other parts of the Mediterranean region, as well as globally. The session will also provide an opportunity to unite around common cultural and socioeconomic concerns (e.g. unemployment, coalition governments, gender inequality, inflation, youth unemployment and intergenerational inequalities, corruption, and patriarchal political and organizational leadership) to propose meaningful interventions to ecological, socio-economic and political vulnerabilities that we are experiencing in current times. Lastly, we believe that bringing these fragmented regions under the Mediterranean span will also be a fundamental policy achievement when incorporating future visions.</p>
