summary: >
  ECOLISE has embarked on a consultation and co-creation process on 10 theses towards transformative local development policies together with many partners and member organisations. The goal? Enabling the political positioning at the European level of community-led initiatives for sustainability and climate change to support an enabling environment for communities and our ecosystems to thrive, create resilience and regenerate. The proposed session consists of a 3-step workshop to prototype the implementation of the 10 theses. The first part will enable participants to get to know a bit about who is in the room. The second part will allow participants to learn about the 10 theses. Finally, the third part will encourage participants to prototype the concrete changes they want to collectively launch. Through sharing concrete personal and collective action plans rooted in personal and collective stories, grounded in specific places and communities.
