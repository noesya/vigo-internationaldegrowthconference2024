summary: >
  This special session calls for a radical overhaul of consumer research and marketing practices and pedagogy to fit a post-growth world. Open to degrowth-minded scholars and practitioners, the session will delve into critical marketing, transformative consumer research, consumer culture theory, macromarketing, and beyond. And conversely, it will examine how these disciplines can inform degrowth strategies, ensuring a mutual enrichment of knowledge and application. Therefore, if you are green-blue-inclusive-sustainable [insert your favourite growth-washing adjective] growth advocate, then this session is probably not for you. We encourage participation from those ready to explore and enact a deep, systemic shift away from traditional growth-centric approach to marketing and consumption, while eschewing cliched and simplistic characterizations of marketing and sustainable consumption for a more nuanced understanding.
