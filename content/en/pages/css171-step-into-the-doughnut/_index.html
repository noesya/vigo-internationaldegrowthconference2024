summary: >
  This interactive session offers an embodied introduction to the Doughnut of Social and Planetary Boundaries that combines movement, playful connections, and personal experience. Participants will be invited to move around the space, self-organising collectively to form and reflect upon embodied notions of overshoot, shortfall and dynamic balance, and to spark connections in pairs that link the social and ecological dimensions of the Doughnut. There may be singing :)
