summary: >
  The subsurface is a source of various services (regulating, cultural, supporting, and provisioning) that support human well-being, but these services are often undervalued and overexploited. The utilization of the subsurface (e.g. geothermal energy extraction, carbon capture and storage, groundwater use) has a lasting impact in the long term. Subsurface use varies based on their depth of occurrence, renewability, and site conditions. With the limited availability of suitable locations for multiple activities, these activities can be in conflict with each other. Wiuth increasing demands and use cases of the subsurface, it is crucial to clarify the sustainable use of the subsurface for defining the limits of utilization. Utilizing the subsurface at sustainable levels demands an interdisciplinary perspective that connects the technical realities of geological sciences with approaches found in ecological economics. Through this session, we would like to draw contributions that combine geological and economic aspects of subsurface management.
