  Like ecosystem, the geosystem is a source of various services (regulating, cultural, supporting, and provisioning) that support human well-being. These geosystem services are often undervalued and overexploited. The utilization of geosystem services (e.g. geothermal energy extraction, carbon capture and storage, groundwater use) has a lasting impact in the long term. With increasing demands and use cases of planet’s geodiversity, it is crucial to clarify the sustainable use of geosystem services for defining the limits of utilization. Utilizing geosystem services at sustainable levels demands an interdisciplinary perspective that connects the technical realities of geological sciences with approaches found in ecological economics. Through this session, we would like to draw contributions that discuss the methodological and conceptual aspects of sustainable scale for managing geosystem services thereby addressing the interactions between earth sciences, ecological economics and environmental sciences.

        <p>Similar to ecosystems, the subsurface as a geosystem is a multi-functional unit that provides supporting, regulating, cultural, and provisioning services. Recently, the term geosystem services has been used to address the services arising from the abiotic structures and processes arising from the geosystem and more specifically the subsurface. The term geosystem services allows for regarding the subsurface as a complex and interlinked system that results in a wide range of uses arising from different depths of the subsurface. Additionally, viewing the subsurface utilization through the lenses of geosystem services acknowledges the various functions of the subsurface that expand from the extraction of resources to the use of the subsurface as a sink to its role in supporting ecosystem functioning. With increasing uses and demand to satisfy the growing needs of industrial production and human consumption, the subsurface is being exploited at a pace that cannot be supported by finite stocks without leading to the degradation and eventual depletion of the resources. There is a looming threat of over-exploitation, therefore it is critical to minimize the risk of depletion and balance conservation with utilization. The existing literature looks at the management of geosystem services through the lenses of conservation i.e. what to conserve? Why conserve? However, it does not inform on how to operationalize sustainable subsurface management in such a way that we can utilize the resources at steady-state. Currently, subsurface management is looked at from an independent activity level (for instance groundwater, critical raw minerals, geothermal energy extraction). The objective of such an approach is to propose management measures based on their respective regenerative rates, and site suitability, therefore optimizing resource use. The concepts of sustainable yield and safe yield are under-represented within such approaches. Additionally, these approaches do not consider the intrinsic value the subsurface provides.  However, it is being recognized that subsurface management should take place in an inter-disciplinary setting that accounts for the interaction between the dimensions of geology and earth sciences, economics and environmental science. It is important to consider the subsurface not only as a system that can provide resources, but also a wide –range of services that can provide more than only economic benefits. There is a need to develop a common understanding of sustainable use based on its different functions, services, and regenerative capacities. Approaches from Ecological Economics such as sustainable scale and viewing the subsurface from the hierarchy of processes – functions – services getting more recognition within subsurface management. The concepts of Ecological Economics allow us to contextualize economic approaches that consider the subsurface as a source of functions and services that cannot be viewed as a free stock that can be harvested without limits. The mix of the regenerative capacity of the subsurface services makes it essential to govern their utilization so that operation can still take place within an ecological limit. Approaches of entropy by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, sustainable scale  by Herman Daly, collective action by Elinor Ostrom and  Joan Martinez Alier are merely some of the relevant approaches that can be used to address the (over)exploitation of subsurface. Addressing the subsurface from this perspective allows for re-evaluating the ongoing utilization rates and establishing limits to subsurface use based on the principles of strong sustainability. Subsurface resource management, when aligned with the degrowth concept, offers a pathway to sustainable, equitable, and environmentally responsible resource use principles. It will contribute to a more balanced and regenerative relationship between the limits of finite natural capital, utilization patterns within the economy and societal structures, essential for a degrowth-oriented future. Addressing the management of services stemming from the subsurface is vital for addressing the management of natural capital comprehensively. The existing approaches to managing natural capital and sustainable scale-of-use are focused on the goods and services provided by the ecosystem. Although geosystem services vary from ecosystem services temporally and spatially, they need to be an active part of the discussion on managing natural capital. </p><p>The proposed session, emphasizes the methodologies and the approaches that are required to reduce resource consumption and waste. Addressing these approaches within subsurface management will promote sustainable practices that can ultimately translate to decreasing pressure on earth’s resources (both ecosystem and geosystem combined). Geosystem services and ecosystem services together make natural capital and act as interlinked systems. By defining the limits of utilization of geosystem services, the interlinkages between geosystem services and ecosystems can also be thoroughly addressed. </p><p>In this conventional parallel session, contributions addressing the management of subsurface drawing that addresses the linkages between geology- environment- society- ecological economics are welcomed. Particularly, addressing the utilization of various functions of the subsurface at a sustainable scale.</p><p>Minimum number of participants: 3</p><p>        </p><p>Maximum number of participants: 6</p>
