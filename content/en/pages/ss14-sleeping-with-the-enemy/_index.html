summary: >
  This panel intends to explore the transformative potential of marketing in a world facing a confluence of crisis. Drawing inspiration from Milton Friedman’s historical impact on global economics, we want to underscore the power of marketing to make ideas politically inevitable. As society grapples with the urgent need for sustainable, degrowth-oriented approaches, we call for a shift in marketing’s traditional principles.
  
  While marketing has historically thrived on promoting growth and consumerism, we believe that it can be harnessed to promote degrowth values, ecological economics and alternative business models aligned with degrowth agenda. This unique perspective challenges the notion that marketing is the adversary of degrowth and true sustainability, showcasing a growing cohort of marketing professionals willing to align their efforts with radical sustainability agendas.
