summary: >
  Language not only reflects and co-creates social universes, but it can also be and is performative regarding the planetary common good, e.g. through international treaties and agreements. At the same time the studies on the language used by policy documents show that: it is inadequate concerning its expected agency; the reasons for that include its anthropocentrism, capitalocentrism and technocentrism; but also that it is possible to rephrase it to address the diagnosed problems in a radically inclusive way.
  
  This interactive workshop investigates the conditions for altering the language used by policy documents to a posthuman mode that is addressing the issue of more-than-human inequality by becoming inclusive towards non-human actors. During the workshop the idea as well as examples will be presented. In the process of group work hands-on practical interventions in chosen excerpts of policy documents will be made. Finally, we will exchange our feelings and experiences.

        <p>The workshop is adressing the issues underpinning the current polycrisis which degrowth aims to adress, namely the structures of exploitation: capitalst and anthropocentric at the same time. The contribution to degrowth is practical: we will expand the sensitivity of the participants in recognizing the oppressive practices from based on human relations only to also those that touch non-human actors and that are based on human mastery and anthropocentrism. To do that, we will diagnose the presence of exploitation in the language of policy documents and enable the participants to react.</p><p>This session is planned as an interactive 90 minutes long workshop with no minimum and maximum number of participants. Space should allow the participants to sit in the circle and then reorganize to smaller circles and back, preferably outdoors, eg. on the grass. The organizers first present the idea of more-than-human inclusion in the language of policy documents and reasons for it. Then they shortly present some examples from their own work, as well as respond to any questions and demands of clarifications. After that it is time for the participants to work in groups on editing in posthuman manner the excerpts of policy texts proposed by the organizers. Finally, everyone will be able to share the results of their work and to discuss them in a forum.<br></p>
