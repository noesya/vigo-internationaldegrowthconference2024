summary: >
  Language not only reflects and co-creates social universes, but it can also be and is performative regarding the planetary common good, e.g. through international treaties and agreements. At the same time the studies on the language used by policy documents show that: it is inadequate concerning its expected agency; the reasons for that include its anthropocentrism, capitalocentrism and technocentrism; but also that it is possible to rephrase it to address the diagnosed problems in a radically inclusive way.
  
  This interactive workshop investigates the conditions for altering the language used by policy documents to a posthuman mode that is addressing the issue of more-than-human inequality by becoming inclusive towards non-human actors. During the workshop the idea as well as examples will be presented. In the process of group work hands-on practical interventions in chosen excerpts of policy documents will be made. Finally, we will exchange our feelings and experiences.
