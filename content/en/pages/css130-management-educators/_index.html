summary: >
  This session will bring together members of the MEND network and collaborators with the aim of further catalysing energy and action to transform management education to address the issues created by a growth economy and transition through degrowth to post growth. The MEND network has this year published its living manifesto to achieve this aim and scaled out to create new nodes and include new members having been established in 2021. The aim of these sessions is twofold: 1) An interactive ‘Reflection’ session to bring new and old members together to learn from each other’s discussions and 2) An ‘Action’ session during which MEND members will co-ordinate and plan further action in line with MEND’s aims. For example, writing work towards the production of a text to guide management educators in their pedagogical approach and teaching methods in embedding degrowth and post growth in their teaching.
