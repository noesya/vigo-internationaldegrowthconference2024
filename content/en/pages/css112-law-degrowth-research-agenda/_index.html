summary: >
  The flourishing field of degrowth studies already formulated over 530 policy proposals (Fitzpatrick, Parrique and Cosme, 2022). However, their implementation requires legal analyses combining in-depth knowledge of the law with creativity. While the legal literature openly tackling degrowth is still limited, degrowth proposals and other post-growth approaches are beginning to gain attention from legal scholars and activists. Given the historical and continuing role of the law in facilitating an economic growth-led, unequal, unjust, and socio-ecologically destructive model, bringing it in line with the degrowth theory is necessary.
  
  In this context, a research agenda taking stock of the advances of legal research on degrowth and blazing a trail for future research is urgently needed. This research agenda encompasses perspectives from many different branches of the law (human rights law, competition law, energy law, environmental law, etc.), from international, regional and national regimes in both Global North and Global South jurisdictions.
