  In a theme of opening consciences, we are keen, with our team, to present to you a play, which will stage, the discovery of priceless and unsuspected truth. Pushing them to question and redirect their steps towards a healthy and harmonious future. From this piece we hope to open hearts with a song to begin with, integrated into the piece. We plan to end with a group song with the troupe and members of the public, for maximum healing. After, there will be an open exchange of ideas, on free questions linked to the piece, and our simple human condition on this earth, the idea being not a debate but a free and constructive exchange between be here present. Finally, around a meditation, we will harmonize together in silence, letting idea, feeling and emotion find their place.
