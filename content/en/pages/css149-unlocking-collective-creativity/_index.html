summary: >
  We invite participants to join for a collaborative workshop that delves deep into the question of why broad-scale socio-ecological transformation is not happening on the collective level. We aim to show how decommodified spaces, which we see as central for creating and embodying degrowth, can be both imagined and created in practice. We’ll explore strategies to cultivate decommodified spaces e.g. via body-mind, coaching, and healing practices, and reflect on the overall importance of these spaces for the degrowth movement.
  
  This creative work session will tap into the collective knowledge in the room, fostering a relaxed yet focused atmosphere that encourages deep engagement and connection through guided prompts and peer-led discussion. The workshop encourages self-reflection on our role as academics or activists, and emphasizes the crucial need to find and live ways of being in a more convivial state of connection to nature – including our colleagues at the conference.
