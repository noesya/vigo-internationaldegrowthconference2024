summary: >
  The challenge of addressing biodiversity loss and unsustainable economic growth requires integrating diverse social perspectives into policy-making. The EU-funded BioAgora project is developing the European Science Service for Biodiversity to act as a bridge between research and policy and create a participatory process for inclusive decision-making. Recognizing the significance of transdisciplinary knowledge production for a degrowth-oriented future, it emphasizes the need for transformative governance and a broader knowledge base. To this end, the forthcoming Science Service fosters the engagement of various stakeholders, including non-traditional knowledge holders.
  
  This workshop organized by BioAgora aims to use a design thinking approach to assess and co-design the governing principles of the Science Service and discuss adequate participation processes, barriers to inclusive policy-making, and possible ways of counteracting the interests of current economic and political elites. This collaborative effort holds the potential to promote more sustainable and inclusive decision-making in biodiversity conservation.
