summary: >
  Many renewable-based large, medium and small energy projects are being pushed to achieve the energy targets and net-zero goals for decarbonization. The renewables are promoted as sustainable and green alternatives. However, studies have reported the failure of renewable-based projects to address questions of social and environmental justice, but the focus of these studies remained on large utility-scale projects. In this session, we wish to analyze the impact of small renewable energy projects in delivering just energy transition in rural areas of the global north and south. How green and just are these environmental and energy transition efforts? Does this top-down, market or state-led &quot;environmentalization&quot; increase local actors' vulnerability and marginality and affect their effective participation? Who finances and drives the community-led energy projects? How are inequality, inequity, access and marginality debated in small renewable projects? The session will re-socialize the overtly environmental debates on energy transitions from the rural perspectives.
