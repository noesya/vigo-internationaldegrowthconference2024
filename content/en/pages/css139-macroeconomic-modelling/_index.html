summary: >
  The session will explore new ideas from simulation models that study society–economy–environment interactions, and that can be used to assess policies. The session will bring together the modelling teams from three researcher projects (ToBe, WISE, and WISER). These projects responded to the same call by the European Union on “Public policies and indicators for well-being and sustainable development”. All aim to design a new economic paradigm beyond GDP metrics based on well-being, inclusion and sustainability. Ecological macroeconomics aims to provide macroeconomic analyses that link environmental impacts, social outcomes, and financial stability to inform discussions on how we can transform the economy to achieve prosperity within planetary boundaries. The ideas presented in this session are related to ecological macroeconomic models combining conventional macroeconomic variables with indicators of wellbeing and sustainability to assess policies from a multidimensional perspective, and to reveal the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the transition to sustainability.
