summary: >
  Degrowth started in France in the beginning of the 2000's when a group of adbuster activists met with academics and intellectuals radically criticising the imperialist concept of development and epistemologically rejecting utilitarianism in social sciences. Since then, Degrowth became a field of research, and it is more and more discussed in well established research societies. Nevertheless, the fundamental criticism of the current system is less apparent related to the knowledge creation process. Questions about how knowledge is created, who the participants are and who benefits from the research results often remain un-reflected.
  
  The aim of this session is to highlight the need of more democratic, participatory approaches, and present possible ways to co-create knowledge in contributing to the transformation. Through a round table discussion with prominent researchers dealing with degrowth and epistemologically reflecting on Degrowth and academia, we would like to explore participatory research methodologies.
