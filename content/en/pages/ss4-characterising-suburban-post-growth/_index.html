summary: >
  There is a growing body of literature analysing the principles of degrowth across the specific challenges of urban planning and urban studies. However, this scholarship remains overwhelmingly urban, and empirical work primarily focused on experiences of planning for degrowth in large cities in Central and Northern Europe. This session seeks to focus the postgrowth debate on the urbanised periphery or suburbs as a critical space, given its unsustainability and its vulnerability to climate change. Is the future of these spaces, as described by mainstream academia and policy discourse, to be densified to achieve ‘the ideal sustainable form’ or is there a postgrowth future that can secure the livelihoods and good quality of life of periurban residents? We seek to establish this debate in the context of European peripheral regions, querying whether these hold politico-cultural and socio-economic characteristics that may put them in an advantageous path for a postgrowth future.
