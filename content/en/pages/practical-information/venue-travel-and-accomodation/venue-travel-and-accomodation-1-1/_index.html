        <p>Pontevedra is located in an area of the province of the same name known as the "Rías Baixas". This region of the autonomous community of Galicia is famous for its pleasant climate, its gastronomic offer, and its beautiful landscapes, both coastal and inland. These are some of the nearby towns worth visiting: </p><p><b>Vigo</b>: this is the biggest town in the region, located only 15 minutes by train from the center of Pontevedra. June is a perfect time to visit this city when the streets are bustling with good weather but tourism is not yet excessive. </p><p>If you go you should not miss a walk along the port and the old town, and a sunset from a bar on one of its sandy beaches, watching the sun go down behind the Cíes Islands.</p><p><b>Combarro</b>: is a small village a few kilometers from Pontevedra, famous for its large number of <i>hórreos</i>, typical old constructions in Galicia, generally made of stone and raised from the ground on several pillars, which were intended to store and preserve food away from moisture and animals. </p>
