        <p>Pontevedra is located in the province of the same name, in an area known as the "Rías Baixas". This region of the autonomous community of Galicia is famous for its temperate climate, its gastronomic offer, and its beautiful landscapes, both coastal and inland. These are some of the nearby places worth visiting: </p><ul><li> <b><a href="https://turismoriasbaixas.com/en/descubre/turismo-litoral/villas-marineras/combarro" target="_blank">Combarro</a></b>: is a small village a few kilometers from Pontevedra, famous for its large number of hórreos, typical old constructions in Galicia, generally made of stone and raised from the ground on several pillars, which were intended to store and preserve food away from moisture and animals.. </li></ul><ul><li> <b><a href="https://turismoriasbaixas.com/en/tu-destino/o-morrazo" target="_blank">O Morrazo</a></b>: is a peninsula located between the estuaries of Vigo and Pontevedra where you can find an infinite number of beaches, large and small, familiar and wild. In its westernmost area is Cabo Home, the closest land point to the Cíes Islands.</li></ul><ul><li> <b><a href="https://turismoriasbaixas.com/en/tu-destino/vigo" target="_blank">Vigo</a></b>: this is the biggest town in the region, located only 15 minutes by train from the center of Pontevedra. June is a perfect time to visit this city when the streets are bustling with good weather but tourism is not yet excessive. If you go you should not miss a walk along the port and the old town, and a sunset from a bar on one of its sandy beaches, watching the sun go down behind the Cíes Islands.</li></ul><ul><li> <b><a href="https://turismoriasbaixas.com/en/tu-destino/imprescindibles/islas-atlanticas" target="_blank">Atlantic Islands - Cíes, Ons and Cortegada</a></b>: these terrestrial paradises located in the Atlantic Ocean are small redoubts of marine and terrestrial biodiversity where you will find wonderful beaches, trails, and lighthouses. However, if you wish to visit them, you must take into account that in both Cíes and Ons visits are limited and/or require prior permission to access.</li></ul><ul> <li> <b><a href="https://www.santiagoturismo.com/" target="_blank">Santiago de Compostela</a></b>: although it is not part of the Rías Baixas, this is a must-see place as it is the capital of Galicia and one of the best-known cities in the autonomous community. It has been a World Heritage Site since 1985, and its cathedral is the destination point for the various pilgrimage routes of the Camino de Santiago (O Camiño, as it is known in Galicia).<br> </li> </ul><p>These are just some of them, but the offer is enormous. Those fortunate enough to extend their stay will have infinite options for all tastes: sea, inland, beach, mountains, cities, villages, culture, and sports. If you are one of those lucky ones and have doubts, the members of the local organizing team will be happy to share their recommendations with you. <br></p>
