summary: >
  Degrowth is a thriving field of interdisciplinary academic research uniquely coupled with a diverse activist movement, and the Degrowth Journal was established in 2022 to give this research a home: a home that allows researchers to expand degrowth imaginaries without a constant need to defend and explain degrowth, a home that facilitates healthy conceptual debate within the movement, and a home that embraces our values, breaking from the profit-led publishing paradigm.
  
  This interactive session will start by introducing the journal’s collective who will explain what motivated them to take the radical step of creating a new journal. The history, values and management of the journal will then be presented, including lessons learnt from publishing the journal’s first volume. Finally and most importantly, this session will provide a space for the degrowth community to discuss their experience with and expectations for the journal, and possibilities for degrowth-inspired academic publishing.
