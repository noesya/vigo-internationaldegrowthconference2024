summary: >
  Academia has been, and has the potential to be, a source of radical thinking and of contributions to a degrowth future. However, currently it is being pressed from all sides to do exactly the opposite, and resistance is ever harder to maintain. Many are being forced to use neoliberal and growth-oriented methods (e.g. building curricula through quantity of publications and grant acquisitions) even when their aim is to contribute to degrowth. It becomes a question of privilege who can do this, and the process severely narrows the sphere of action, making it dependent on charismatic engagement with the status-quo and quantity over quality. This session aims to proactively seek ways out of this alarming tendency, encouraging presenters and the audience to describe the problem in their context, but also to share geographical, social, political, organizational, economic, cultural, linguistic, technological or psychological means by which their field could help “rescue” academia.
