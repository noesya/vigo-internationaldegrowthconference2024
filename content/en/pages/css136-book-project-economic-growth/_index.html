summary: >
  This Special Session discusses a current book project on growth imperatives and growth dependencies. The purpose of the anthology is to make the academically still little established research field of growth imperatives and growth dependencies more visible and to provide an overview of the quite diverse approaches developed yet for researchers and the interested public. In this session, we will first introduce the overall framing of the book. After that, three chapters of the book will be presented: 1) Two types of growth imperatives and their normative differences; 2) Employment and growth (in)dependence; 3) Regulation Theory and Japan: towards a new theorisation and application for the growth (in)dependence concept. The presentations will be followed by approx. 30 minutes of discussion.
