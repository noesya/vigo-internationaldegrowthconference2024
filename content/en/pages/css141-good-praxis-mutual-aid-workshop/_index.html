summary: >
  Good Praxis is art education for climate justice, celebrating successful models of resistance and survival. As not everyone can participate in blockades or strikes, mutual aid gives people agency to organise themselves to meet the needs that are not being met by people in power. Based on solidarity, not charity, this support is called mutual aid.
  
  In this workshop, artists Lars Holdhus, Juha van 't Zelfde and Arnau Sala Saez will introduce the concept of mutual aid with examples from around the world.
  
  Following the introduction, we will do a mutual aid workshop to outline the group's wants, haves and needs and draw up possible new mutual aid projects (across borders and local). Mobilising on a grassroots level can be essential to introduce degrowth principles locally and across borders. Through this workshop, you can learn how art can drive change, create new initiatives and strengthen local communities. 
  
  This workshop is open to artists, activists and researchers.
