summary: >
  Degrowth envisions societies overcoming resource depletion, uncontrolled pollution, climate catastrophe and biodiversity loss while promoting planetary regeneration, human well-being and autonomy in a post-capitalist future that entails less material consumption, particularly in the Global North. The concept of health is central to the idea of wellbeing in the degrowth framework but remains undefined and tied to surrogate parameters such as life expectancy, which, notably in high-income countries, are related to increased health expenditure and depend on GDP growth.
  
  Hence, this proposal for a special track on health and care aims to discuss the constraints of modern growth-orientated biomedical health systems, debating the embedded logic that drives them and exploring alternative approaches towards health and care in a post-growth future.
