summary: >
  Waste is the immanent outcome of any social metabolism. Metabolic processes continuously produce wastes in the form of discarded materials, heat and pollution that accumulate in the environment. The claims that the waste issue can be solved through a fully circular economy, or the dematerialisation of production, are physically impossible in any growth-dependent scenario. Degrowth can offer substantial solutions to this crisis. Yet, degrowth scholarship has generally overlooked the waste issue, as it has mainly focused on the production stage of our socio-economic systems. However, how can we manage already-existing wastes, and those that will be produced even in a shrinking social metabolism? This special session aims to address this question from a degrowth perspective. It will allow to expand degrowth scholarship towards waste and waste studies, to connect degrowth-oriented scholars already working on the issue, and to identify degrowth-aligned perspectives and solutions to address the waste crisis.
