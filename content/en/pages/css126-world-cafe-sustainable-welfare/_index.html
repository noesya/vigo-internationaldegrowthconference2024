  How do we provide sustainable welfare for all without undermining planetary wellbeing? Eco-social policies tackling ecological and social problems in simultaneous and integrative manner will play crucial roles in post-growth societies. Overcoming the growth-dependency of current welfare states requires new ideas and perspectives. Using the world-café method, researchers, practitioners, and other conference participants can meet through this interactive session and discuss innovative proposals of eco-social policy such as working time reduction, universal basic services, maximum income, and green job guarantee. Researchers with expertise in these proposals will act as the café hosts and the participants will discuss transformative potentials as well as problems and barriers in implementing them.

        <p>Sustainable welfare as a new paradigm in social policy deals with the problem of how to provide human welfare without undermining planetary wellbeing, by studying policy solutions that aim to create synergy between social justice, ecological sustainability, and democratic participation (Fritz &amp; Lee, 2023). Eco-social policies are the concrete policy instruments which translate the goal of sustainable welfare into practice. With this interactive session we aim to create a creative and welcoming opportunity for exchange among researchers, practitioners and the public. Using the world-café method, we would like to introduce and discuss the innovative proposals of eco-social policy that as yet largely remain in the realm of academic discussions. Our session contributes to facilitating a researcher-led participatory policy process where new imageries of a post-growth future are articulated in terms of concrete eco-social policies for sustainable welfare.</p><p><b>World-café in action</b></p><p>To begin the session, the session organizers will welcome everyone and briefly introduce the concept of sustainable welfare and eco-social policies. We will then introduce the topics that will be up for discussions during the session, explain the timetable and what the café hosts and café guests are expected to do during the session (15 mins introduction). Next, all participants will be seated around 5 different tables (max. 4-5 participants for each table, plus one presenter which is the café host). The café hosts will briefly introduce specific eco-social policy items such as working time reduction, maximum income, green job guarantee, universal basic income, and universal basic services. After that, discussions take place in each table where the café guests discuss the following questions: i) what concrete actions, norms and values will be promoted when a given eco-social policy is implemented?; ii) what problems and weakness of the instrument are there, and what barriers will there be in implementing the policy item? After these first 20 minutes of discussions around the tables, the café hosts remain at the same table, but the guests move on to another table to reflect on the same questions but taking on different eco-social policy items. After three consecutive rounds of discussion (60 min in total), all café participants and hosts will have open discussions together (15 min). Ideally, we’d like to secure one more time slot for this interactive session, so that we can continue the discussion sessions (five instead of three rounds) where we can also allow the café hosts to move beyond one’s own table. This will also allow us more time for exchanging ideas among the participants.<br></p><p><b>Who will participate?<br></b></p><p>The café hosts - presenters that will be seated at each table with designated eco-social policy items - will be selected by the organizers of the session prior to the conference. Session organizers will utilize the network of sustainable welfare and eco-social policy as well as personal contacts. We will invite scholars who have active research activities on the theme and who are interested in and committed to the role of public deliberation process in policy research for transformative changes.<br></p><p>As to the café guests, ideally, we would like to attract a mix of researchers, practitioners, and interested local population to this interactive session. We will disseminate the call for participants using our professional networks relevant for the theme and will actively seek for one or two local civil society organizations in Pontevedra that work with issues such as climate justice, just transition, wellbeing economy, local commons project, etc. We will aim at recruiting at least 15 to 20 confirmed participants including the café hosts and guests prior to the conference. We will therefore leave a possibility for other conference participants (10 to 15 persons) to join the café spontaneously.<br></p><p><b>Special requirements<br></b></p><p>We would like to request two time slots for this interactive session to maximize the opportunity for meaningful discussions and exchanges of ideas. The world-café format of the session is best executed with help of adequate arrangement of furniture in the room. Ideally, we would like to have 5 round tables and for each table we would like to have 6 chairs. A white board would be great to have, alternatively, a possibility to use a projector. The room should be suitable to host about 30 persons. It is important that the session organizers can access the room at least 30 minutes before and after the actual session, in order to arrange the furniture and decorate the room into a welcoming environment. Two time slots (180 minutes) would allow us to include this preparation time as well.<br></p><p><b>Previous experiences<br></b></p><p>Martin Fritz (PhD in sociology, 2016, male and based in Germany) and Jayeon Lee (PhD in social work, 2018, female and based in Sweden) have previously organized a special session titled “From an aspirational policy framework to a real agent of change? Critical questions in the science-policy nexus of sustainable welfare and eco-social policy”, during the 14th International Conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics, June 2022 in Pisa. The session attracted 8 academic presentations and the networking activity stemming from the session since then has successfully led to a publication of a special issue on the topic of sustainable welfare and eco-social policies in a major international academic journal, Journal of European Social Security (full issue publication in December 2024). In Jayeon’s recently finalized research project, “Sustainable welfare for a new generation of social policy”, led by prof. Max Koch at Lund university, she had a major responsibility over the content and all practical matters for 11 deliberative citizen forums conducted in Sweden during 2020. Kajsa Emilsson (PhD in social work, 2022, female and based in Sweden) has her expertise in studying the public support for eco-social policies, a highly relevant theme for organizing the session building on public engagement. The session organizers have also previously successfully acted as session/panel organizers in other international conferences.</p>
