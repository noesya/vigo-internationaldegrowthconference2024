  How do we provide sustainable welfare for all without undermining planetary wellbeing? Eco-social policies tackling ecological and social problems in simultaneous and integrative manner will play crucial roles in post-growth societies. Overcoming the growth-dependency of current welfare states requires new ideas and perspectives. Using the world-café method, researchers, practitioners, and other conference participants can meet through this interactive session and discuss innovative proposals of eco-social policy such as working time reduction, universal basic services, maximum income, and green job guarantee. Researchers with expertise in these proposals will act as the café hosts and the participants will discuss transformative potentials as well as problems and barriers in implementing them.
