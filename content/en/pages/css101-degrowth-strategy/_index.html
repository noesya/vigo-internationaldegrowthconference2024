summary: >
  Degrowth has been at the centre of ecological economics since the days of its inception. Recently, degrowth scholarship and practice have turned to questions of strategy as a precondition for developing a theory and practice of social-ecological transformation. This session critically contributes to these debates by drawing on Buch-Hansen’s assessment of two – not yet actualised – prerequisites for a degrowth paradigm shift: building a comprehensive coalition of social forces and achieving broad-based consent. Against this background, the discussion in this session is based on the following guiding questions: How to build strategic alliances beyond like-minded groups? What kind of vocabulary, narratives and policies have the potential to resonate with majority populations? How to mobilise mass publics for degrowth? What pathways have the potential to achieving broad-based consent, overcoming barriers, and defending such a project against backlash? And where does the degrowth movement currently hit its strategic wall?
