summary: >
  Just Transition assumes the need for sustainable policies to tackle social inequalities. In particular, the role of workers is key. Against the background of two national research projects, the session assesses a global debate and discusses its implication in the Italian context. Some theoretical issues are debated - most notably, the notions of class composition, form of life, prefiguration, agriculture 4.0 - and some case-studies analyzed - for example the GKN occupied factory in Campi Bisenzio (Florence) and the Civitavecchia plan for turning a coal plant into a hub of renewable energy production. The session aims to discuss how are the ecological transition and digitalization redefining work, how different degrees of workers’ involvement and (contentious and prefigurative) interference into the production processes e.g. by means social-mobilization can contribute to different trajectories of ecological transition, and what are the challenges and trade-offs involved, and the role of contextual factors.
