summary: >
  In August 2020, was publishe Exploring Degrowth: A Critical Guide (Pluto Press, Vincent Liegey, Anitra Nelson). This book is an invitation to explore what is degrowth since its birth in 2002. Around a provocative slogan, décroissance, launched in France stared a movement first inspired by post-development and in the continuity of alter-globalist movements. Degrowth was later translated into English and became a flourishing academic field.
  
  Since then, other books, academic articles have been published, debates on degrowth have been opened in mainstream medias, in politics.
  
  But Exploring Degrowth is still going on: how to analyse the critics, feedbacks, updates and perspectives around degrowth in the last years. What are the pending controversies, the gaps, the expectations around degrowth?
  
  The co-authors of Exploring Degrowth propose a participatory session to analyse, debate on the last dynamics from diverses perspectives.
