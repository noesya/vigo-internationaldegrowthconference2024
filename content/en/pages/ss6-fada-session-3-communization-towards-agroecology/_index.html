summary: >
  The covid pandemic showed that care work is still disproportionately performed by women and feminized populations, both privately and in state-led institutions. This trend, embedded in the fabric of capitalism (Denger and Lang, 2022; Federici, 2004), relies and fortifies other forms of inequality: racism, heteronorm, bordering regimes, etc. Relatedly, degrowth feminists (Pérez Orozco 2014, Stensöta 2015) have emphasized the importance of ending the sexual division of labor and making care a communal task. Building on this framework, the papers in this session will reflect (both theoretically and empirically) on possibilities of organizing the work that sustains life outside of the options offered by the market and the state. The authors will bring together experiences and analysis from social movements, intentional communities, and utopian spaces (broadly defined) to discuss the potentialities and challenges of collective interdependence and ecodependence.
