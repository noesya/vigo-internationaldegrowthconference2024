        <p>The organization of a scientific event of this nature represents a unique opportunity to bring the public closer to science; to make known to society the work done by researchers in the fields of ecological economics and degrowth; to raise public awareness of the need to establish new ways of social development and to address the ecological transition; and to highlight the importance of society and scientific community to approach, understand each other and establish collaborations. </p><p>With these objectives in mind, Pontevedra Degrowth 2024 comprises different activities focused on the civil society, emphasizing young people.<br></p>
