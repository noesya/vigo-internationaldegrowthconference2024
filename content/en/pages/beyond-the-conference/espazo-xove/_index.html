        <p>One of the most innovative aspects of the conference is the creation of a space for young people to actively participate. The <b><i>Espazo Xove</i></b> (Youth Space) arises from the <b>ambition to connect science with the general population</b>, an ambition shared by all those involved in organizing the conference in one way or another. </p><p>The <i>Espazo Xove</i> is realized through the attendance of adolescents at various conference sessions, but also through a <b>physical space where diverse activities will take place</b>, such as workshops, poster presentations, talks, or roundtable discussions. This space aims to serve as a bridge between the conference and the educational community associated with the participants.  </p><p>The <i>Espazo Xove</i> is, in turn, the outcome of a project that will take place in the city of Pontevedra during the academic year 23/24, <b>Postgrowth SA: Pontevedra</b>. It is a citizen science project funded by the <a href="https://www.fecyt.es/en" target="_blank">FECYT </a>(Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology) in the field of social sciences aimed at generating knowledge on how to flourish in cities without the constraint of economic growth. Throughout the academic course, 1st-year high school students and the involved faculty will become social scientists and participate in the research. The project counts also with the suppor of the European project ERC Starting Grant <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.webs.uvigo.es/prospera/" target="_blank">PROSPERA</a> "Prospering without growth: Science, Technology, and Innovation in a post-growth era" (GA 947713). The <i>Espazo Xove</i> <b>will allow all participants to disseminate the research results and carry out public engagement activities</b> to involve different sectors of society, including individuals from political, administrative, business, and academic domains.</p>
