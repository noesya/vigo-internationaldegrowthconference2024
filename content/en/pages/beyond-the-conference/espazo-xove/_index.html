        <p>One of the most innovative aspects of the conference is the creation of a <i>youth space</i>, a space for young people to actively participate in the conference. The <i>Espazo Xove</i> (<i>Youth Space)</i> arises from the ambition to <b>connect science with the general population</b>, an ambition shared by all those involved in organizing the conference in one way or another. </p><p>The <i>Espazo Xove</i> is realized through the attendance of adolescents at various conference sessions, but also through a physical space where diverse activities will take place, such as workshops, poster presentations, talks, or roundtable discussions. This space aims to serve as a bridge between the conference and the educational community associated with the participants.Â </p><p>The <i>Espazo Xove</i> is, in turn, the outcome of a project that will take place in the city of Pontevedra during the academic year 23/24, <i><b>Postgrowth SA: Pontevedra</b></i>. It is a citizen science project in the field of social sciences aimed at generating knowledge on how to flourish in cities without the constraint of economic growth. Throughout the academic course, 1<sup>st</sup>-year high school students and the involved faculty will become social scientists and participate in the research being conducted under the European project ERC Starting Grant <b><i>PROSPERA </i></b>"Prospering without growth: Science, Technology, and Innovation in a post-growth era" (GA 947713). The <i>Espazo Xove</i> will allow all participants to disseminate the research results and carry out public engagement activities to involve different sectors of society, including individuals from political, administrative, business, and academic domains.<br></p>
