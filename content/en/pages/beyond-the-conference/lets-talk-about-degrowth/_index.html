        <p>Degrowth roots can be traced back centuries ago, however the first mentions to the term date from 70s by authors such as André Gorz. Recently, Degrowth, as we know it now, which began as a social movement during the last two decades, has expanded into academia and become an academic concept that may be considered as an example of activist-led research and has informed over 600 academic papers since 2007. </p><p>It is now used as an umbrella term, but it must be understood as a holistic term that pulls from a broader heritage of critical thought while also offering a fresh framework that is essential for addressing the challenges that we face.  </p><p>Degrowth is an interpretive framework for a new social movement in which several streams of critical ideas and political action converge. It is an attempt to re-politicise debates about socio-environmental futures, as well as an example of activist-led research that is now becoming a topic in academic circles. Given the importance and academic impact of degrowth, several perspectives have opened trying to define this field of study. Some of the definitions given to degrowth are based on studies of ecological economics, a trajectory that combine the downscaling of throughput of energy, materials and waste flows of the economy while increasing well-being. </p><p>Some others focus on its potential of challenging the dominant ways under which the economy is studied, understanding degrowth as an attempt to radically critique economics itself and a critique of economic thinking as a form of knowledge that became dominant with the growth imperative. </p><p>Even if there are several definitions of what degrowth means and aims, it seems that the common basis is acknowledging and aiming a reduction in production and consumption to lighten the ecological footprint, democratically planning in a spirit of social justice and concerning for well-being. It is also based on some clear principles, such as enabling ecological and social justice, strengthening self-determination and redesigning institutions and infrastructures. </p><p>Degrowth is seen as a temporary stage towards an ecologically and socially sustainable post-growth economy which may be presented as a stationary economy in harmony with nature, based in democratic principles, and where wealth is shared equitably to prosper without growth.  </p><p>During last years several academic works has been done in order to compile and organize existing work on degrowth, showing its different currents and debates, some of them on controversial topics such as technology and the role of the state. By revisiting the definition of degrowth, its academic work and the strategies to go from the academic debate to societal transformation, degrowth aims to contribute to transforming society to overcome urgently the existing eco-social crises. </p>
