        <p>The roots of the degrowth movement can be traced back centuries, however the first mentions of the term date from the 1970s by André Gorz. Degrowth, as we currently know it, has <b>coalesced into a social movement during the last two decades</b>, simultaneously expanding into academia, informing several books and academic papers since 2007. </p><p>Degrowth can be understood as a holistic term that pulls from a broader heritage of critical thought while also offering a refreshing framework that is essential for addressing the most pressing socio-environmental challenges facing humankind. It is an interpretive framework for a <b>new social movement in which several streams of critical ideas and political action converge</b>. It is both an attempt to re-politicise debates about socio-environmental futures, and an example of an activist-led research agenda which increasingly informs knowledge production activities across a range of academic disciplines.   </p><p>Degrowth has different meanings across the various institutions and disciplines that engage with the concept. <b>Definitions emerging out of ecological economics combine the aims of downscaling throughputs of energy, materials, and waste flows with increasing human well-being</b>. Others focus on the <b>potential of degrowth to challenge dominant modes of economic knowledge production</b>. These approaches understand degrowth as a tool to radically critique economics itself, especially the paradigm of economic thought that relies on and stabilizes the growth imperative.</p><p>Even if there are several definitions of degrowth, the common basis is a <b>broad aim to reduce production and consumption</b>, to radically reduce the ecological footprint, with a<b> focus on</b> <b>democratic planning in a spirit of social justice and concern for human and environmental well-being</b>. It is also based on some clear principles, such as enabling ecological and social justice, strengthening self-sufficiency, and redesigning institutions and infrastructures. </p><p>Degrowth is seen as a temporary stage in pursuit of an ecologically and socially sustainable post-growth economy. This may be presented as a <b>stationary economy in harmony with nature, built on democratic principles</b>, and where access to wealth and resources are shared equitably.  </p><p>During the past few years, several reviews have been published, compiling and organizing existing work on degrowth and showcasing its different currents and debates, including those around controversial topics such as the role of technology, knowledge production, and the state. <b>The conference seeks to deepen knowledge and creativity around these key questions posed by the degrowth community and to create a space to formulate strategies</b> for the mobilization of this expanding area of knowledge production in pursuit of societal transformation and to address the accelerating eco-social crises. </p>
