summary: >
  This workshop proposes an interactive session on the possibilities and pitfalls of seizing state power. Whilst the role of grassroots social movements is idealised, the majority of degrowth proposals prioritise state intervention (Cosme et al., 2017). A conclusion confirmed by a recent survey of the degrowth movement where the majority strongly agree that “solving social and environmental issues requires taking state power” (Fitzpatrick et al., forthcoming). Assumptions that are inherited by ecological economists who take the states for granted by using reductionist statements to justify the existence of states that ignore degrowth's anarchist roots and lack evidence (D’Alisa &amp; Kallis, 2020). This comes despite nuanced internal (Alexander &amp; Gleeson, 2020) and external (Baker, 2023) critiques of seizing state power. In short, the critique of seizing state power is ignored despite little-to-no strategies on how to seize state power. The question remains: to seize or not to seize?
