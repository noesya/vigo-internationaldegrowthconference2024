summary: >
  Metamorfosis is a groundbreaking project based in Barcelona, bridging the realms of degrowth and queer ecology.
  
  This event invites participants to a transformative and safe space where the struggles for queer liberation and environmental protection converge. Metamorfosis addresses pressing issues such as eco-anxiety among the youth, the urgency for socio-ecological transformation, and the need for a paradigm shift in ecology by fostering inclusivity, open dialogue, art and activism. It offers a platform for critical knowledge exchange, exploration, and collective action to catalyse the shift away from destructive economic growth towards a more sustainable, joyful society.
  
  Embodying alternative knowledge transfer, this event aims to make these values expand in order to reach society's cognitive, affective and existential dimensions, thus bringing about a necessary and complex metamorphosis.
  
  Metamorfosis blurs the boundary between academia and activism, offering a unique space for change-makers to envision a more harmonious future collectively.
