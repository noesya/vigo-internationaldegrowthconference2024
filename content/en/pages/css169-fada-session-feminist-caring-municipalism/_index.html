summary: >
  Both climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have uncovered and reinforced overlapping crises of care in urban settings, especially as they concern socially vulnerable groups and their overlapping needs and identities (Amorim Maia et al. 2021; Manzanedo &amp; Manning, 2019). In response, caring cities, including places such as Vienna, Barcelona and Bremen in Europe, or Rosario and ValparaÃ­so in Latin America have become global phenomena with their potential to transform societies and everyday politics along the ethics and practices of care. Often in connection to this, the municipalist movement, which is reshaping urban policy-making in cities around the world, is actively pushing for a feminization of urban politics and a re-centering of care in municipal spaces (Kussy et al., 2023, Bookchin, D., &amp; Colau, A. (2019). This special session will take these initiatives as examples for how care can be socialized in practice, aiming to co-learn from municipalist governments in Barcelona, Madrid, etc. as well as from other municipal strategies for commonizing care work.
