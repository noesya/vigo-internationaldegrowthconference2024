summary: >
  The increasing corporate control on inputs, outputs and supply chain of agriculture presents a major challenge towards achieving just and sustainable agri-food systems worldwide. Led by the values of endless growth, monopoly, control, and ‘food from nowhere’ these dominant models of agriculture are a major contributor to environmental degradation and injustices to producers and consumers. Alternative Food Networks (AFN), as situated, relational and care-based ways of imagining and mobilizing agri-food systems, have emerged in response to the challenges posed by these dominant models. This interactive panel brings together 5 women to tell stories of their personal journeys, motivations, experiences and challenges of being a farmer in AFNs in Galicia, Spain. Story-telling in this session is aimed to unpack the entanglements of the personal and the political, an important aspect of feminist politics and theory, that has still been marginally explored in the de-growth literature and movements.
