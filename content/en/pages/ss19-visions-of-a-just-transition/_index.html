summary: >
  The concept of “just transition” has evolved from a reactive project aimed at safeguarding workers in polluting industries into a comprehensive eco-social project pursuing intertwined environmental and social justice objectives. Yet the precise definition and implementation of a just transition remain debated, opening a rich discussion avenue not only for those focused on “just transition&quot; but also for scholars exploring wider socio-ecological justice issues. This session, aiming for future-oriented analyses, invites contributions focusing on various visions, scenarios, imaginaries, trajectories, and conceptualizations of just transition, including scenarios of just transition across different scales and contexts, justice in socio-ecological transformations, and the dynamics of socio-ecological inequalities amid ongoing societal transformations. This open session encourages a wide range of methodological approaches and interdisciplinary explorations. Post-conference, the aim is to collate discussions into a special issue or a collective document, potentially extending the dialogue through additional formats like a round-table discussion.
