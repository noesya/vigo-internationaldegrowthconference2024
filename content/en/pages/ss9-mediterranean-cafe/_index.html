summary: >
  To deliver on climate ambitions, voices and solutions that amplify regional and local particularities and place-based approaches must be incorporated into research, policy and action. This implies incorporating visions specific to the Mediterranean region carried out in Southern Europe, the Levant and Northern Africa with regard to local geographies and particular themes such as heat waves, forest fires, water scarcity, agricultural losses, polarization, far-right populism, autocracy, displacement and migration - all core axes of discussion for a future under degrowth.
  
  This special session will focus on specificities of the Mediterranean Region, one of the &quot;&quot;hotspots&quot;&quot; of the climate crisis with pronounced vulnerability grappling with the rising emissions while being home to over 500 million people. A Mediterranean cafe-style session will welcome participation focusing on regional particularities with global implications, critical voices, methodologies and solutions for climate-resilient development from the South while also valuing local researcher talents working on common issues.
