        <p>Special sessions aim to complement the program with relevant topics related to degrowth and ecological economics that are not among those proposed by the organization and have a particular interest to the audience. Each of these sessions will extend for a conference time-slot (with a maximum duration of 1,5 hours), in parallel to regular sessions.<br></p>
