        <p>The conference is organized in accordance with the core values and principles of both degrowth and ecological economics.  The host organization, Post-Growth Innovation Lab, as well as the conference’s Organizing Committee similarly follow these values and principles. In the following, we describe these in further depth:</p><p><b>Cooperation</b>: We cooperate with local as well as international individual and collective actors. These range from local government to international activist groups.</p><p><b>Involvement of civil society</b>: The conference seeks to involve a variety of local actors. We will host a number of events that will create the opportunity to bring the local and scientific community together.  Given that scientific knowledge is often perceived as being very distant from the public eye, this event seeks to promote and enable new ways of knowledge exchange (in both directions). </p><p><b>Sustainability</b>: We aim to have the least environmental and social impact possible in the preparation and execution of the conference. This concerns in particular the choice of catering, location, and suppliers of other materials.</p><p><b>Solidarity</b>: We aim to promote solidarity among conference participants by offering a "solidarity fee". This will entail an optional higher registration fee for better-established participants in order to fund to a large extent the participation of students and academic staff from less-privileged backgrounds.</p><p><b>Inclusivity</b>: The event aims to be as inclusive as possible by providing step-free access for people with mobility needs. Further, we will provide the possibility of sign language interpreters if required. Finally, we will cater to a range of dietary requirements and preferences e.g., lactose and gluten intolerance as well as allergies.<br></p><p><b>Equality</b>: Equality with regard to gender, race, and LGBTQ+ representation is important in the organization of this conference. All conference committees and organizing bodies strive to be gender equal and are spaces of free expression. The conference will emphasize the use of inclusive language both in official communication as well as in the event itself.</p>
