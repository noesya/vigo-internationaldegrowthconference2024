        <p>Currently, modern science faces a fundamental and ultimately paradoxical situation: while an increasing number of scientists question the endless pursuit of growth and refute its imaginary, the majority of science, technology and innovation (STI) institutions are transitioning towards a model that increasingly favours and funds applied research to boost economic growth. From engineering to applied sciences, the practice and discourse surrounding STI has been instrumental to align knowledge production with endless capitalist expansion. Therefore, a society beyond growth must learn how to articulate new imaginaries and relations between society and the institutions of science, technology and innovation.</p><p>We desperately need to decouple STI from the pursuit of endless growth, and yet not enough reflection has been put into this important task. By and large, conversations about how to repurpose STI as socio-political phenomena, and decouple it from the instrumental purposes of capitalist accumulation have been held at the margins of Ecological Economics and Degrowth. We think it is about time to move this conversation to the centre and encourage a more open engagement with colleagues in other disciplines. It is in this context that we propose the overarching theme ‘Technology, Science and innovation beyond growth’ as an open invitation to engage with other scholarly traditions that problematise technological imaginaries and practices, even if they have not yet made the explicit connection with degrowth debates. In fact, this conference call provides a timely opportunity to build new bridges between scholars focusing on the ways in which power and politics shape science and technology, and vice versa. Our conference will enable new links between degrowth, Ecological Economics, and other communities in the social sciences, including studies in Science, Technology and Society (STS), Critical Management and Organization Studies, Responsible Research and Innovation studies and others. </p><p>Below, we provide a range of potential themes and broad questions which can guide this discussion. Applicants will submit their work to one of the 11 sessions, <b>not </b>to the specific subthemes. Subthemes are <b>indicative </b>of the content that would potentially fit within each of the 10 sessions, but submissions on topics that are not explicitly listed are also welcomed.</p>
