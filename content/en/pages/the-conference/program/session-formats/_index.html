      Posters

      text: >-
        <p>Poster sessions will have the same importance as all the other sessions. Even more, the works accepted under this modality will achieve greater visibility as they will be on <b>public display uninterruptedly for the duration of the event</b>, and a digital version of each poster will be <b>permanently exposed on the website</b>. </p><p>The poster modality will have a <b>one-hour slot during two of the conference days</b>, in which the authors will have the opportunity to explain their work and answer questions from the audience. </p><p>Since <b>creativity is a very important theme</b> for this Conference, the organization board encourages participants to let it fly wild when preparing the posters, without leaving aside the rigorousness but trying to explain the work in a visual way capable of capturing the attention of the public. </p><p>In order to give this modality of participation the importance it deserves, the <b>prize for the best poster</b> (Best Poster Award) will be awarded during the Closing Ceremony. The winner will be chosen by the conference attendees, who will have to rate not only the scientific interest of the work but also its creativity and visual impact. </p>
