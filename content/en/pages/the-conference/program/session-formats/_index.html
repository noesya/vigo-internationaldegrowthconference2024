        <p>Conventional sessions will be organized in <b>1.5 hours slots</b> (having up to 12 parallel sessions per slot). Each session will count on a chair assigned by the Organization and the Scientific Committee, and the presentations will be <b>about a common topic</b> (there can be more than one session about the same topic during the Conference). The topics of the sessions will be those proposed by the Organization and the special topics selected after the “special sessions” call. </p><p>There will be a <b>maximum of 4 presentations per parallel session</b>, and the participants will count on a <b>maximum of 15 minutes for each presentation</b> so that there can be enough time to have an enriching discussion.</p>
