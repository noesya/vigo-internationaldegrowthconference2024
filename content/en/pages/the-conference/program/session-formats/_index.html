        <p>We welcome <b>practice-based reflections and art works which engage with the goals and messages of degrowth and ecological economics</b>. Creatives including (but not limited to) artists, filmmakers, literary writers, theatre and performance-makers, designers, musicians, street artists, socially-engaged practitioners, collectives, and curators are invited to share and reflect upon their work. Your practice might respond, for example, to subjects such as the personhood of nature, care, hope, interdependence, more than human perspectives, energy, contamination, or waste. We also invite submissions of <b>artworks which will be considered for live and/or virtual exhibition and/or performance</b> during the conference.<br></p>

        <p>Poster sessions will have the same importance as all the other sessions. Moreover, the works accepted under this modality will achieve greater visibility as they will be on <b>public display uninterruptedly for the duration of the event</b>, and a digital version of each poster will be permanently displayed on the conference website.</p><p>The poster modality will have a<b>&nbsp;slot during several of the conference days</b>, in which the authors will have the opportunity to explain their work and answer questions from the audience. &nbsp;</p><p>Since thinking outside of conventional boundaries is an important theme for this conference, <b>we encourage participants to be creative in preparing the posters</b>, without leaving aside rigor. Aim to explain the work effectively and dynamically to capture public imaginations.</p>
