        <p>Special Sessions aim to give space within the Conference to special tracks that are not among those proposed by the organization, sessions with a unique topic and format, or groups of people that want to present the progress or results of a specific project. We invite special sessions that provide artistic or interactive avenues to learn, debate, and co-create in transdisciplinary manners, such as dancing, futuring, visioning, painting, sculpture, songwriting, theatre, improv, poetry, backcasting, world cafés, board games, yoga and meditation etc.<br></p>

        <ul><li> <b>Open Special Sessions</b>: sessions organized in the framework of a track related to degrowth and ecological economics that is not among those proposed by the organization and have a particular interest to the audience. This would also be the option for those interested in being in charge of a session with a very specific topic and characteristics within one of the tracks proposed by the organization of the conference. These sessions will be open to the participation of any applicant during the “call for abstracts” period that will open in November. </li></ul><ul><li> <b>Closed Special Sessions</b>: organized in the framework of a specific project or activity, always related to the Conference theme. These sessions will not be open to the participation of any applicant, only those allowed by the session proposers and organizers could participate as presenters. </li></ul><p>The selected Special Sessions will be carried out within the parallel session slots. </p><p>Applicants both to Open Special Sessions as well as to Closed Special Sessions must indicate in the application form in which session <a href="https://esee-degrowth2024.uvigo.gal/en/the-conference/program/session-formats/" target="_blank">format</a> their proposed sessions would be developed (conventional, interactive, poster, or artistic modalities). </p>
