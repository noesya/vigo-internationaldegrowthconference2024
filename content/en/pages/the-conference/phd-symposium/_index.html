summary: >
  We are kicking off the ESEE-Degrowth Conference 2024 with a PhD symposium that is geared towards doctoral students who wish to advance their academic skills and connect with others on how to (better) navigate academia. There will be three interactive sessions with skill-shares on grant writing and ‘how to survive academia’ that speak on care and collaboration, tips on publishing critical research, and non-academic communication and arts. All are designed to support those whose research questions mainstream discourses, such as the growth imperative with degrowth, and support doctoral students’ transition to the next step in their careers. Participation is free, but applying and registration is mandatory since the number of places is limited to 30 students.
