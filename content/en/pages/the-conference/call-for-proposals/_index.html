        <p>Currently, modern science faces a fundamental and ultimately paradoxical situation: while an increasing number of scientists question the endless pursuit of growth and refute its imaginary, the majority of science, technology and innovation (STI) institutions are transitioning towards a model that increasingly favors and funds applied research to boost economic growth. From engineering to applied sciences, the practice and discourse surrounding STI has been instrumental to align knowledge production with endless capitalist expansion. Therefore, a society beyond growth must learn how to articulate new imaginaries and relations between society and the institutions of science, technology and innovation. <br>We desperately need to decouple STI from the pursuit of endless growth, and yet not enough reflection has been put into this important task. By and large, conversations about how to repurpose STI as socio-political phenomena, and decouple it from the instrumental purposes of capitalist accumulation have been held at the margins of Ecological Economics and Degrowth. We think it is about time to move this conversation to the center and encourage a more open engagement with colleagues in other disciplines. It is in this context that we propose the overarching theme ‘Technology, Science and innovation beyond growth’ as an open invitation to engage with other scholarly traditions that problematize technological imaginaries and practices, even if they have not yet made the explicit connection with degrowth debates. In fact, this conference call provides a timely opportunity to build new bridges between scholars focusing on the ways in which power and politics shape science and technology, and vice versa. Our conference will enable new links between degrowth, Ecological Economics, and other communities in the social sciences, including studies in Science, Technology, and Society (STS), Critical Management and Organization Studies, Responsible Research and Innovation studies, and others.    Below, we provide a range of potential themes and broad questions which can guide this discussion, but these are by no means exhaustive:<br></p><ol></ol><p><b>Theory: </b>I<b>magining post-growth Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) futures </b></p><ol> <li>In which ways can post-growth / degrowth help us rethink STI discourse and practice? </li> <li>What are the main barriers and opportunities for degrowth-minded ideas to shape our technological imagination?</li> <li>What levels of technological complexity are compatible with degrowth and what are the main trade-offs involved? </li> <li>How to promote degrowth among other scientific and technical disciplines? </li> <li>How do we leverage science to promote degrowth? </li> <li>Science and epistemological plurality: complementarity or an impossible combination? </li> </ol><ol></ol><p> <b>Practice: Creativity without growth </b></p><ol> <li>How can we reclaim creativity and innovation discourses from their current association with growth-oriented purposes? </li> <li>In which ways can degrowth maximize the potential for a more creative and innovative society? </li> <li>What does it mean to be creative or innovative in a world where the economy is not centered around the pursuit of economic growth? </li> <li>How to decolonize and collectivize innovation? </li> <li>What can we learn from existing examples of organizations decoupling innovation and creativity from growth? </li> <li>How do we engage the public in these debates?</li> </ol><p><b>Political Action:</b><b> STI Policy Making for Degrowth</b> <br></p><ol> <li>What is the role of STI policies in achieving degrowth? </li> <li>What institutional and governance mechanisms are required to align STI endeavors with degrowth values? </li> <li>Science is political! How can we steer it towards promoting and envisioning a degrowth society?</li> <li>How do we reshape scientific institutions to enable degrowth? </li> <li>Politics of transition and strategy: how do social movements (eco-socialism, ecofeminist, labor, anti-racist, environmental/climate/blue justice, students and degrowth) relate to radical STI imaginaries? <br> </li> </ol>
