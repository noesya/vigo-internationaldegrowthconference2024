summary: >
  We may achieve the transformation of the system, but if we have not transformed ourselves along the way, we will be destined to equally corrupt the degrowth society. This is the starting point for a session that explores our internalized growth mindsets. It will move beyond exploration by offering practices that will assist the liberation of minds and souls colonized by growthism. We seek to recognize and amplify practices based on post-growth values to organize societies in a different way, learning from psychoanalysts, philosophers, activists, people of faith, healers, anthropologists of science, abolitionists, among others.  Our three key threads are (1) inner emancipation &amp; de-alienation, (2) psychoanalysis, (3) ecopsychology. The session will include individual as well as interactive practices such as meditation, breathing, prayer, as well as embodied exercises (embodied mapping of positionalities), guided journalling and art-based methods such as poetry and music.
