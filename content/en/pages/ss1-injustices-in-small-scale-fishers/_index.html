summary: >
  Small-scale fishing activity is fundamental to maintaining nutrition, subsistence, identities, and sustainable livelihoods around the world. However, they are amongst the most vulnerable groups to climate change impacts. This session aims to visualize existing injustice in small-scale fishery systems, due to governance, social and economic factors, including socially blind conservation and climate interventions, lack of inclusivity (including gender and diverse knowledge systems), or the imbalances in the distribution of climate change impacts. We will combine testimonies of fishers confronting climate change with scientific evidence on the barriers and limitation that this collective has, together with the main limitations of current scientific approaches and climate interventions. We welcome contributions looking at the vulnerability, the responses of fisheries under climate change impacts, climate interventions, as well as evidence on the role of governance and institutions, including the social and economic formal and informal settings that ultimately can achieve more just fisheries social-ecological systems.
