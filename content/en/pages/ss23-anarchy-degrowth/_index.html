summary: >
  Anarchy, as opposed to anarchism (GA, 2005; Anonymous 2013), seeks to go beyond the formal ideology of anarchism, instead to extend this to focusing on the spirit of revolt (Bakunin, 1990) and anarchist tension (Bonanno, 1998) that extends beyond its limiting ideological confines. Meanwhile, degrowth drawing on values such as autonomy, care, democracy (Barloway et al., 2022) with obvious connections to anarchist and anti-authoritarian practices, has so far prioritised influencing public policy and statism (Fitzpatrick et al., 2022; Toro, 2021) diverging from its values and affinity with anarchism. This session aims to advance thinking around anarchy/degrowth by exploring the pluriverse of ‘degrowth practices’ as they intersect with anarchist and anti-authoritarian practices and enhance degrowth as a counterforce to statism and capitalism.
