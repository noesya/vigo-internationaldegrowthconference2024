summary: >
  The discourse on degrowth has progressively matured evolving into a critical lens towards the conventional growth paradigm that dominates economic and business landscapes. Thus far, debates on the role of businesses in degrowth have revolved around the identification of business characteristics which would be aligned with degrowth both in general as well as in specific areas such as innovation, marketing, value creation, relation-with-profit . But businesses are not monolithic structures, and multiple logics, values and motivations coexist. This plurality does not imply that different logics are equal in terms of influence and power to shape business practices. In fact, the opposite is true and degrowth-oriented logics tend to be supressed in the context of businesses. The focus of this special session is to explore the internal dynamics, conflicts, resistances, and confrontations that manifest within business organisations as they seek to contribute to a post-growth transition.
