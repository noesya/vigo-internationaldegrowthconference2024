summary: >
  The session provides an opportunity to focus on how post-growth and degrowth theory plays out in specific geographies and the infrastructural technologies that make places liveable. There is already a strong and growing body of work on applying post and degrowth theories to the specific challenges of urban planning and authors are beginning to focus on specific infrastructural technologies. Yet, there is still within the literature, something of a dearth of mid-level theorising and policy analysis that engages with the often paradoxical nature of infrastructures. Infrastructure functions both as the underpinning to a quality of life all are entitled to whilst consuming energy and resources and oftentimes is explicitly oriented towards and designed to facilitate yet more economic growth.
