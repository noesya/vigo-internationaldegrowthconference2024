summary: >
  The materiality of resource extraction and its impacts have been challenged through centuries by local and extra-local groups that defend land and water, and increasingly link their fight with alternative visions of development. The logic of extractivism, even if sometimes not explicitly, is being challenged by post-capitalist pluriverse proposals, eco-feminist ideas, as well as degrowth that advocates for a regenerative way of doing, feeling and acting.
  
  The present panel aims at unifying in narrative and practical terms these two aspects of opposition towards extractivism, in order to craft a path towards a post-extractivist future that involves those fighting on the ground as well as the subjects of growth and its logics.
