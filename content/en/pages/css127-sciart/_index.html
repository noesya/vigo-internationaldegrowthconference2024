summary: >
  This is a special session which presents the work of the “Sciart” project conducted at the European Commission’s Science and Knowledge service: the Joint Research Centre. Here artists, scientists and policymakers work together in transdisciplinary projects blending stardust and DNA, poetry with climate modelling, dance and law, post-normal science with Serresian poetics, semiotics and Quattrocento Florence. In this interactive session held with artists, scientists and policymakers we will dialogue together about the how, what and why of the project, and collectively examine how Sciart might be relevant to the objective of degrowth. We will watch artists' videos, play games, hear about topics such as agriculture, water contamination and forest fires, discuss and debate epistemological pluralism, imaginations of the future, the science-democracy gap, and slow science, as well as creative methodologies for responsible innovation, technological change, institutional barriers to creative practices and the governance of knowledge production and policymaking.
