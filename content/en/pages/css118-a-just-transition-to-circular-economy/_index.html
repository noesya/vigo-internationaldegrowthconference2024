  This session aims to showcase the insights and outcomes of the Just2CE project. The Just2ce project assesses the current state of transition towards the circular economy (CE) in relevant economic sectors and analyses possible transition scenarios, as well as their outcomes and impacts. In doing so, it sheds light on the following research questions: which theoretical frameworks inform the dominant and alternative perspectives on CE? Which ideological positions underpin them? Which are the industrial sectors driving CE research and policy developments, and which ones are instead neglected? Which stakeholder groups are included and in which roles, and which are excluded and why? The workshop will present the output of all six project work packages and will enable an interactive discussion on the key insights and recommendations they bring. It will also provide a space to discuss the project's future, how to best disseminate its outputs, and plan for its closing.
