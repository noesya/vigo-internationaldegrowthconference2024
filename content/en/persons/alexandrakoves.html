<p>Alexandra Köves<br>is an ecological economist, associate professor at the Corvinus University of<br>Budapest in the Department of Decision Sciences and head of the Ecological<br>Economics Research Centre at the Corvinus Institute for Advanced studies. She<br>teaches subjects related to decision sciences, ecological economics, and<br>Degrowth. Her research focuses partly on decisions influencing sustainability<br>transitions, and partly on sustainability scenarios using participatory<br>research techniques. She graduated with an MA in International Business and<br>Languages from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland in 1999. Her MPhil<br>degree is from the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna. She received her PhD from the<br>Corvinus University of Budapest in 2015, having worked on the topic of<br>sustainable employment within the field of ecological economics. In the first<br>decade of her career, she worked with development programmes in the fields of<br>employment policy, social integration, vocational training, adult- and higher<br>education. After having realised that what we call development currently is<br>neither sustainable, nor socially just, in 2011 she turned towards re-examining<br>the theoretical principles in academia. She joined Corvinus as a faculty member<br>in 2014. Since then, she has become an advocate of ecological economics in<br>Hungary trying to introduce this research field to both students and a wider<br>audience, running a podcast series called “Green Equality” with now over 150<br>episodes. She is also host of the English-language podcast of the European<br>Society of Ecological Economics called Economics for Rebels. Since the 1<sup>st</sup><br>of January 2022, she is vice-president of the European Society of Ecological<br>Economics.</p>
