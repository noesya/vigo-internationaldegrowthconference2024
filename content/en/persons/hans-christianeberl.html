<p><b>"</b>I am Austrian, born in Linz in 1965, raised in Lower Austria, studied in Vienna, working and living in Brussels since 2008. Married with one child, plus two twenty-somethings that I inherited from my wife's first marriage.   I am a chemical engineer with an additional BA in history, and a few publications including a book on contemporary cultural studies.   My first job was emission measurements and risk calculations at TUV Vienna, then I was part of the circularity core team at the Austrian Ministry of Environment. I initiated the first industrial symbiosis network in Austria, and was in charge of the first national report under the Waste Statistics Regulation.   I joined DG ENV in 2008 for an internship, when I wrote the triennial Waste Shipment Report, which I decided to make a six-year report, both to improve the data quality and to catch up with reporting obligations, and I stayed with ENV until 2015 as a national expert. I was in charge of the RoHS Directive - the restriction of hazardous substances in electronics, a dossier at the interface of products, waste and chemicals policies, heavily contested by stakeholders and NGOs.   After two years at the European Parliament's ENVI Secretariat, where I mainly worked on circular economy topics, energy efficiency, and chemicals legislation, I joined DG RTD in 2017.   At RTD, I authored a report on policy recommendations from R&amp;I on circularity in products and I wrote the majority of the circular economy R&amp;I calls since the 2020 work programme. My favourite call is the one in the 2023 work programme on 100 circular households, which targets the sustainability transition from a socioeconomic perspective.   I am the coordinator for all things circular in the unit, and I am involved in the preparations for the 2025-2027 work programme. I am also managing two EUR 1M studies under Horizon Europe, on circular value chains and on novel indicators for circularity. Both topics are getting much attention from ENV, EIB, EEA, ESTAT, etc., as policy in this field is emerging and better guidance is needed, e. g., for investments or EPR schemes.   I also participated in a staff exchange programme with REA, because I wanted to learn more about project management, and to understand the challenges that our executive agency is facing with our R&amp;I calls".<br></p>
