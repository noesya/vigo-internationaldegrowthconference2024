<p><b>"</b>I am Austrian,<br>born in Linz in 1965, raised in Lower Austria, studied in Vienna, working and<br>living in Brussels since 2008. Married with one child, plus two<br>twenty-somethings that I inherited from my wife's first marriage.<br><br> <br><br>I am a chemical<br>engineer with an additional BA in history, and a few publications including a<br>book on contemporary cultural studies.<br><br> <br><br>My first job was<br>emission measurements and risk calculations at TUV Vienna, then I was part of<br>the circularity core team at the Austrian Ministry of Environment. I initiated<br>the first industrial symbiosis network in Austria, and was in charge of the<br>first national report under the Waste Statistics Regulation.<br><br> <br><br>I joined DG ENV in<br>2008 for an internship, when I wrote the triennial Waste Shipment Report, which<br>I decided to make a six-year report, both to improve the data quality and to<br>catch up with reporting obligations, and I stayed with ENV until 2015 as a national<br>expert. I was in charge of the RoHS Directive - the restriction of hazardous<br>substances in electronics, a dossier at the interface of products, waste and<br>chemicals policies, heavily contested by stakeholders and NGOs.<br><br> <br><br>After two years at<br>the European Parliament's ENVI Secretariat, where I mainly worked on circular<br>economy topics, energy efficiency, and chemicals legislation, I joined DG RTD<br>in 2017.<br><br> <br><br>At RTD, I authored<br>a report on policy recommendations from R&amp;I on circularity in products and<br>I wrote the majority of the circular economy R&amp;I calls since the 2020 work<br>programme. My favourite call is the one in the 2023 work programme on 100<br>circular households, which targets the sustainability transition from a<br>socioeconomic perspective.<br><br> <br><br>I am the<br>coordinator for all things circular in the unit, and I am involved in the<br>preparations for the 2025-2027 work programme. I am also managing two EUR 1M<br>studies under Horizon Europe, on circular value chains and on novel indicators<br>for circularity. Both topics are getting much attention from ENV, EIB, EEA, ESTAT,<br>etc., as policy in this field is emerging and better guidance is needed, e. g.,<br>for investments or EPR schemes.<br><br> <br><br>I also<br>participated in a staff exchange programme with REA, because I wanted to learn<br>more about project management, and to understand the challenges that our<br>executive agency is facing with our R&amp;I calls".<br></p>
